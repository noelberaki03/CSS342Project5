The enrollment system is designed to manage student enrollment in courses across multiple universities. 
The system consists of four interconnected classes including Student, Course, University, and EnrollmentSystem.
The Student class stores individual student information and their courses.
The Course class stores information on one course, tracks the class roster, and manages the class list generation.
The University class encapsulates the institution, storing student and course collections,
and provides functions for course management and enrollment checks.
The EnrollentSystem class is the interface for the entire system and manages multiple universities, courses, and students.
